They can range from being dull and aching to being intense and persistent, and can significantly lower your quality of life. At our Presentation we will help you to find Natural Solutions to your Headaches or Migraines, and help you to find on-going support.</p><p>We will talk about the common causes and symptoms of Headaches and Migraines. We will explain about how your Hormones may be involved, will look at Food Allergies/Sensitivities and their role in headaches, and explain how Nutritional deficiencies may be adding to your pain. We will also talk about Tension Headaches and how muscle strain, poor posture, tight muscles and other mechanical issues can cause Headaches and what you can do for this type of pain. We will offer ideas on how we can formulate a specific and completely individualised treatment plan to help you overcome these conditions, by assessing your individual causes, symptoms, sensitivities and aggravations. And all of this by using Natural, safe and effective solutions.</p><p>Our Qualified Practitioners will be available after the presentation for one-on-one time if you would like to discuss your individual needs and we will have resources and information that you can use to reduce your symptoms.</p><p>Spaces are strictly limited to 12 people, and tickets must be purchased through the Eventfinda Link.</p><p>About Essenciel and Trio Health: Essenciel is an Organic and Natural Health center based in Wellington on Cuba Street We aim to provide the best therapeutic treatments to suit your own needs as we all are unique human beings.

Nevertheless, there may be an inflammatory snowball effect occurring inside. Unresolved inflammation, visible or not, becomes more problematic the longer it keeps interfering with the normal workings of your body, and has been linked to many types of chronic disease.</p><p>At this event, you'll learn about the causes of inflammation and the body's normal responses to it. You'll also learn what happens when chronic inflammation occurs, and the effects it can have on the body over a longer period of time. We'll give you take home tips on what you can do to reduce inflammation, and we'll talk about some of the treatment options that we have at the clinic that can help you reduce your pain.</p><p>We'll cover mechanical treatments and talk about therapeutic nutritional products for pain and inflammation relief. We'll also look at the role of the gut in inflammatory processes.</p><p>You'll be given the opportunity to speak with our Qualified Practitioners one-on-one while you are here, and we can help get you on track to living a healthier, more comfortable life.</p></div></div><div class="ButtonMoreLess"> <p id="showMore" >show more...</p><p id="showLess" >show less...</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="bottom"> <div class="container "> <div class="reserv row"> <div class="col-md-6"> <h2>Get in touch.</h2> <h3> <span class="gt">Online Bookings:</span> On <a href="http://www.ezybook.co.nz/pages/essencielmassagetherapy/"> EZYBOOK </a></h3> <h3><span class="gt">General Enquiries: </span>Call: 04-385 7552</h3> <h4><a href="contact-us.html"><span class="boldContact">Contact us via email</span></a></h4> </div><div class="col-md-6 follow"> <h2>Follow us!</h2> <p>By Following Essenciel, you will receive all last up-date, Promotions and Fantastic Deal.<br>This is the faster way to know more about Essenciel Massage Therapy</p><script src="https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js" async defer></script> <div class="g-page" data-width="273" data-href="//plus.google.com/u/0/117540736642471053664" data-layout="landscape" data-rel="publisher"></div><div class="facedebook"> <p>Find us on: </p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/EssencielMassageTherapy"><img src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/36adecfdbb923bc3ece82afbc/images/5bb95efa-c2f2-424d-ba47-b12c4f84f6bd.jpg"></a> <div class="fb-like" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/EssencielMassageTherapy" data-width="300" data-layout="standard" data-action="like" data-show-faces="true" data-share="true"> </div></div></div></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-56032d19c220099c" async="async"></script> </div></body> </html>
